                   Reviews are common. You’ll find them everywhere but the one you are reading right now is not a review. I, am writing my heart out. When I joined SDSM, it was just a college, a place where I had to study. It was a new start of my life, far from home. I was anxious, of course, but that anxiousness never remained for long. I never realised that I was already become a member of a big family, a family that would always be there for me, for the next four years. Teachers, who are your real mentors, who will guide you, who will be there for any help you need. Labs, open 24×7 for us.  The vibrant campus, filled with joy and happiness, all the time. Management staff, who just treat you as if you are no new and they know you from the time you were born. And how can I forget, the time we spend, studying, innovating, researching, joy, events, friends and what not.<br><br>
This is what packs in my college, my SDSM. A 100% recommendation to join, there is no better place than this.
                 </p>

                  SDSM was like my second home where I got the opportunities to explore myself in every party of it which helped me to know my weaknesses as well as my strength.<br><br>
The faculties in SDSM are so professional that they not only help you in their respective subjects but also in helping the overall growth of the students.<br><br>
SDSM T&P CELL is consist of very professional people’s who knew everything about what a student should know as a fresher and what they should impart in his/her career to make a better person not only to getting a job but also in terms of society they are working.<br><br>
At last I want to say that my 3 years of experience in SDSM was very enriching, it has given me some good friends, teachers who I can never forget in my life.
